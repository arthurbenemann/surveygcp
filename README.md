Survey GCP 
==========
This is an Android app to help with the placement of Ground Control Points when doing aerial survey missions. The code has been forked from [Droidplanner_v1.2.0](https://github.com/DroidPlanner/droidplanner), since that app droped the support of GCP in newer releases.

This app has not been released yet.
>If you just want to download the app goto [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.droidplanner.gcp).
